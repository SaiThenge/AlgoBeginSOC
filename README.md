✅ Week 4 – Graph Algorithms

Graph Concepts: Nodes, edges, representations (adjacency list/matrix).

Traversals: Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS).

Advanced Graph Techniques:

Cycle Detection

Topological Sort (Kahn’s algorithm, DFS-based)

Shortest Path Algorithms (Dijkstra, Bellman-Ford)

Minimum Spanning Trees (Kruskal’s, Prim’s)

Union-Find / Disjoint Set Union

SCC (Bonus: Strongly Connected Components)

Visualization & Debugging: Focus on understanding flow before coding.

Applied Practice: Targeted problem-solving on graph-heavy platforms and contests.

✅ Week 5 – Dynamic Programming (DP)

Core Concepts: Breaking problems into overlapping subproblems and solving via recursion + memory.

DP Techniques:

Recursion: Base approach to understand the problem structure.

Memoization (Top-Down): Cache subproblem results to avoid recomputation.

Tabulation (Bottom-Up): Build solutions iteratively using a table.

Classic Problems:

Fibonacci Sequence

0/1 Knapsack

Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)

Coin Change

Subset Sum

Optimization Strategies:

Time & Space Optimization (e.g., using 1D instead of 2D arrays where possible)

Understanding and defining states (dp[i], dp[i][j])

Writing correct transitions between states

Learning Method:

Start with brute-force → move to memoization → convert to tabulation.

Visualize recursion trees and DP tables.

Debug step-by-step through transitions.

Applied Practice:

LeetCode, HackerRank, AtCoder, Codeforces, and GeeksforGeeks – problem sets focused on real DP interview patterns.

Mindset Shift:

Focus on state transitions and problem structure, not memorizing templates.

Revisit solved problems to reinforce understanding and recognize common patterns.
