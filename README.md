Graph Concepts: Nodes, edges, representations (adjacency list/matrix).

Traversals: Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS).

Advanced Graph Techniques:

Cycle Detection

Topological Sort (Kahn’s algorithm, DFS-based)

Shortest Path Algorithms (Dijkstra, Bellman-Ford)

Minimum Spanning Trees (Kruskal’s, Prim’s)

Union-Find / Disjoint Set Union

✅ Week 5 – Dynamic Programming (DP)

Core Concepts: Breaking problems into overlapping subproblems and solving via recursion + memory.

DP Techniques:

Recursion: Base approach to understand the problem structure.

Memoization (Top-Down): Cache subproblem results to avoid recomputation.

Tabulation (Bottom-Up): Build solutions iteratively using a table.

Classic Problems:

Fibonacci Sequence

0/1 Knapsack

Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)

Coin Change

Subset Sum

Optimization Strategies:

Time & Space Optimization (e.g., using 1D instead of 2D arrays where possible)

Understanding and defining states (dp[i], dp[i][j])

Writing correct transitions between states

Learning Method:

Start with brute-force → move to memoization → convert to tabulation.

Visualize recursion trees and DP tables.

Debug step-by-step through transitions.

Applied Practice:

LeetCode, HackerRank, AtCoder, Codeforces, and GeeksforGeeks – problem sets focused on real DP interview patterns.

Mindset Shift:

Focus on state transitions and problem structure, not memorizing templates.

Revisit solved problems to reinforce understanding and recognize common patterns.

✅ Week 6 – Python Libraries for Competitive Programming

Why Use Libraries:

Pre-written code collections that simplify development, reduce boilerplate, and improve efficiency in problem-solving.

How to Use Libraries:

Properly import libraries (import module, from module import ...)

Navigate official documentation to explore functions and usage

Practice solving problems with and without libraries to understand their utility

Core Libraries to Master:

math: Fast mathematical functions (gcd, sqrt, factorial)

collections: Advanced data structures (Counter, deque, defaultdict)

heapq: Priority queues using min-heaps

bisect: Binary search operations on sorted lists

itertools: Combinatorics, permutations, efficient looping tools

functools: Memoization (lru_cache), decorators, higher-order functions

sys: Fast input/output operations (stdin.readline)

random: Random number generation (useful for testing, simulations)

string: Useful constants like ASCII letters and digits

Documentation & Resources:

Official Python Docs (linked for each module)

🎥 FreeCodeCamp: Core Python Modules

📄 GeeksforGeeks: Python Modules Overview

💡 RealPython: Standard Library Highlights

🧪 PracticePython.org for hands-on coding challenges

Pro Tip:

Focus on knowing how to explore and use libraries, not memorizing functions. Documentation is your best coding companion.

Applied Practice:

Incorporate libraries into coding problems to:

Enhance readability

Reduce time complexity

Focus more on logic than boilerplate
